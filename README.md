There are some online games which I really love playing, but only a limited number of puzzles are available each day. So I decided to reverse-engineer them.

## Pattern matching (WIP)

Select three cards which all have either the same or different shape, color, number, and shading.

This is a WIP: gameplay is incomplete and just console.logs a statement about whether the selected set is valid.

Tools:
- D3.js

## Spelling game (WIP)

Spell valid English words (4 or more letters, no proper nouns) using only the provided letters. All words have to contain the center letter. You get extra points for words that contain all 7 letters.

This is a WIP: currently has only basic styling/layout and is lacking some features that would improve clarity (see comment in src/spelling/index.js)

Challenges:
- Find a better dictionary/find a non-tedious way to filter out words that are too obscure

Tools:
- React
